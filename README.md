I'm a passionate geoscientist with a strong background in data analysis. My expertise lies in working with geophysical measurements data, programming geophysical inversion algorithms in python, research and implement appropriate Machine Learning algorithms and tools and perform statistical analysis and fine-tuning using test results in laboratory geomechanics for rock fracture . Proficient in handling massive datasets, I am adept at leveraging advanced analytics to derive valuable insights.
